        <h1>Aravind acts in a play</h1>

        <h3>An Enemy of the People</h3>
        <h4>Author:Henrik Ibsen</h4>

        <p>
            <p>
           <h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4>
            I hope the whole town will be fools enough.</p>

            <p><h4>Morten Kiil.</h4>
             The whole town! Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. It would
            just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. They think themselves
            so much cleverer than we old fellows. They hounded me out of the
            council; they did, I tell you—they hounded me out. Now they shall pay
            for it. You pull their legs too, Thomas!</p>
            
            <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> Really, </p>
           
            <p>[HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door.]</p>
            
            <p><h4>Hovstad.</h4> Good morning! <p>[Stops.] </p>Oh, I beg your pardon</p>
            
            <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> Not at all; come in.</p>
            
            <p><h4>Morten Kiil.</h4> <p>[with another chuckle]</p> Oho!—is he in this too?</p>
            
            <p><h4>Hovstad.</h4> What do you mean?</p>
            
            <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> Certainly he is.</p>
                        
            <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> <p>[giving him the MS.]</p> Here it is; take it with you. It
                can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back later on.</p>
            
            <p><h4>Hovstad.</h4> Good, good! That is what I will do. And now goodbye, Doctor.</p>
            
            <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> Goodbye, goodbye. You will see everything will run quite
                smoothly, Mr. Hovstad—quite smoothly.</p>
            
                <p><h4>Hovstad.</h4> Hm!—we shall see.</p> <p>[Bows and goes out.]</p> 
            
                <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann .</h4><p>[opens the dining-room door and looks in]</p> Katherine! Oh,
                you are back, Petra?</p>
            
          <p><h4>Petra .</h4><p>[coming in] </p>Yes, I have just come from the school.</p>
            
          <p><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4><p>[coming in]</p> Has he not been here yet?</p> 
            
          <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> To offer me his support too. They will support me in a
                body if it should be necessary. Katherine—do you know what I have got behind me?</p>
            
            <p><h4>Petra.</h4> And to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!</p>
            
            <p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4> So so, thank you. <p>[To DR. STOCKMANN.]</p> I received from
                    you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition of the water at the Baths.</p>
            
            <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4> Yes. Have you read it?</p>
            
           <p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4> Yes, I have,</p>
            
           <p><h4>Dr. Stockmann </h4><p>[controlling himself]. </p>Peter—if you were not my brother—</p>
            
           <p><h4>Petra </h4><p>[throwing open the door].</p> Father, you shan't stand this!</p>
            
           <p><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4><p> [coming in after her] </p>Petra, Petra!</p>
            
           <p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4> Oh, so you have been eavesdropping.</p>
            
           <p><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4> You were talking so loud, we couldn't help it!</p>
            
           <p><h4>Petra.</h4> Yes, I was listening.
            <p><h4> Billing.</h4><p>[stretching himself].</p> Ah!—one feels a new man after a meal like that.</p>

            <p><h4>Hovstad.</h4> The mayor wasn't in a very sweet temper tonight, then.</p>
