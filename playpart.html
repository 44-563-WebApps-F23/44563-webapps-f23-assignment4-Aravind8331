        <h4>Author:Henrik Ibsen</h4>

           <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span>
           <p> I hope the whole town will be fools enough.</p>

           <span class="char"><h4>Morten Kiil.</h4></span>
             <p>The whole town! Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. It would
            just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. They think themselves
            so much cleverer than we old fellows. They hounded me out of the
            council; they did, I tell you—they hounded me out. Now they shall pay
            for it. You pull their legs too, Thomas!</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span><p> Really, </p>
           
            <p><span class="dir">(HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door.)</span></p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Hovstad.</h4></span> <p>Good morning! </p><p><span class="dir">(Stops.)</span> </p><p>Oh, I beg your pardon</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span> <p>Not at all; come in.</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Morten Kiil.</h4></span> <p><span class="dir">(with another chuckle)</span> <p>Oho!—is he in this too?</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Hovstad.</h4></span> <p>What do you mean?</p>
            
           <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span> <p>Certainly he is.</p>
                        
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span> <p><span class="dir">(giving him the MS.)</span> <p>Here it is; take it with you. It
                can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back later on.</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Hovstad.</h4></span> <p>Good, good! That is what I will do. And now goodbye, Doctor.</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span> <p>Goodbye, goodbye. You will see everything will run quite
                smoothly, Mr. Hovstad—quite smoothly.</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Hovstad.</h4></span><p>Hm!—we shall see.</p> <p><span class="dir">(Bows and goes out.)</span> 
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann .</h4></span><p><span class="dir">(opens the dining-room door and looks in)</span> <p>Katherine! Oh,
                you are back, Petra?</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Petra .</h4></span><p><span class="dir">(coming in) </span><p>Yes, I have just come from the school.</p>

            <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span><p> To offer me his support too. They will support me in a
                body if it should be necessary. Katherine—do you know what I have got behind me?</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Petra.</h4></span> <p>And to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!</p>
            
                <span class="char"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span><p> So so, thank you. <p><span class="dir">(To DR. STOCKMANN.)</span></p> <p>I received from
                    you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition of the water at the Baths.</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span><p> Yes. Have you read it?</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span> <p>Yes, I have,</p>

            <span class="char"><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4></span> <p>Oh, so you have been eavesdropping.</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4></span> <p>You were talking so loud, we couldn't help it!</p>
            
            <span class="char"><h4>Petra.</h4></span> <p>Yes, I was listening.
            <span class="char"><h4> Billing.</h4><p><span class="dir">(stretching himself).</span></p><p> Ah!—one feels a new man after a meal like that.</p>

            <span class="char"><h4></h4>Hovstad.</h4></span> <p>The mayor wasn't in a very sweet temper tonight, then.</p>

            <span class="char"><h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4></span><p>It is his stomach; he has wretched digestion.</p> 

            <span class="char"><h4>Hovstad.</h4></span> <p>I rather think it was us two of the "People's Messenger" that
                he couldn't digest.</p>
