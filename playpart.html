        <h3>An Enemy of the People</h3>
        <h4>Author:Henrik Ibsen</h4>

        <p>
           Dr. Stockmann. I hope the whole town will be fools enough.

            Morten Kiil. The whole town! Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. It would
            just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. They think themselves
            so much cleverer than we old fellows. They hounded me out of the
            council; they did, I tell you—they hounded me out. Now they shall pay
            for it. You pull their legs too, Thomas!
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Really, I—
            
            Morten Kiil. You pull their legs! (Gets up.) If you can work it so that
            the Mayor and his friends all swallow the same bait, I will give ten
            pounds to a charity—like a shot!
            
            Dr. Stockmann. That is very kind of you.
            
            Morten Kiil. Yes, I haven't got much money to throw away, I can tell
            you; but, if you can work this, I will give five pounds to a charity at
            Christmas.
            
            (HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door.)
            
            Hovstad. Good morning! (Stops.) Oh, I beg your pardon
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Not at all; come in.
            
            Morten Kiil (with another chuckle). Oho!—is he in this too?
            
            Hovstad. What do you mean?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he is.
            
            Morten Kiil. I might have known it! It must get into the papers. You
            know how to do it, Thomas! Set your wits to work. Now I must go.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Won't you stay a little while?
            
            Morten Kiil. No, I must be off now. You keep up this game for all it is
            worth; you won't repent it, I'm damned if you will!
            
            (He goes out; MRS. STOCKMANN follows him into the hall.)
            
            Dr. Stockmann (laughing). Just imagine—the old chap doesn't believe a
            word of all this about the water supply.
            
            Hovstad. Oh that was it, then?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that was what we were talking about. Perhaps it is
            the same thing that brings you here?
            
            Hovstad. Yes, it is, Can you spare me a few minutes, Doctor?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. As long as you like, my dear fellow.
            
            Hovstad. Have you heard from the Mayor yet?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Not yet. He is coming here later.
            
            Hovstad. I have given the matter a great deal of thought since last
            night.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Well?
            
            Hovstad. From your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science,
            this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. I mean, you do
            not realise that it involves a great many other things.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. How do you mean?—Let us sit down, my dear fellow. No,
            sit here on the couch. (HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch, DR. STOCKMANN
            On a chair on the other side of the table.) Now then. You mean that—?
            
            Hovstad. You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to
            impurities in the soil.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass
            up at Molledal.
            
            Hovstad. Begging your pardon, Doctor, I fancy it is due to quite
            another morass altogether.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. What morass?
            
            Hovstad. The morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is
            rotting in.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce are you driving at, Hovstad?
            
            Hovstad. The whole of the town's interests have, little by little, got
            into the hands of a pack of officials.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Oh, come!—they are not all officials.
            
            Hovstad. No, but those that are not officials are at any rate the
            officials' friends and adherents; it is the wealthy folk, the old
            families in the town, that have got us entirely in their hands.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, but after all they are men of ability and knowledge.
            
            Hovstad. Did they show any ability or knowledge when they laid the
            conduit pipes where they are now?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. No, of course that was a great piece of stupidity on
            their part. But that is going to be set right now.
            
            Hovstad. Do you think that will be all such plain sailing?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Plain sailing or no, it has got to be done, anyway.
            
            Hovstad. Yes, provided the press takes up the question.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I don't think that will be necessary, my dear fellow, I
            am certain my brother—
            
            Hovstad. Excuse me, doctor; I feel bound to tell you I am inclined to
            take the matter up.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. In the paper?
            
            Hovstad. Yes. When I took over the "People's Messenger" my idea was to
            break up this ring of self-opinionated old fossils who had got hold of
            all the influence.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. But you know you told me yourself what the result had
            been; you nearly ruined your paper.
            
            Hovstad. Yes, at the time we were obliged to climb down a peg or two,
            it is quite true—because there was a danger of the whole project of
            the Baths coming to nothing if they failed us. But now the scheme has
            been carried through, and we can dispense with these grand gentlemen.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Dispense with them, yes; but, we owe them a great debt
            of gratitude.
            
            Hovstad. That shall be recognised ungrudgingly, But a journalist of my
            democratic tendencies cannot let such an opportunity as this slip. The
            bubble of official infallibility must be pricked. This superstition
            must be destroyed, like any other.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I am whole-heartedly with you in that, Mr. Hovstad; if
            it is a superstition, away with it!
            
            Hovstad. I should be very reluctant to bring the Mayor into it, because
            he is your brother. But I am sure you will agree with me that truth
            should be the first consideration.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. That goes without saying. (With sudden emphasis.) Yes,
            but—but—
            
            Hovstad. You must not misjudge me. I am neither more self-interested
            nor more ambitious than most men.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. My dear fellow—who suggests anything of the kind?
            
            Hovstad. I am of humble origin, as you know; and that has given me
            opportunities of knowing what is the most crying need in the humbler
            ranks of life. It is that they should be allowed some part in the
            direction of public affairs, Doctor. That is what will develop their
            faculties and intelligence and self respect—
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I quite appreciate that.
            
            Hovstad. Yes—and in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy
            responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating
            the masses—the humble and oppressed. I know well enough that in
            exalted circles I shall be called an agitator, and all that sort of
            thing; but they may call what they like. If only my conscience doesn't
            reproach me, then—
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Quite right! Quite right, Mr. Hovstad. But all the
            same—devil take it! (A knock is heard at the door.) Come in!
            
            (ASLAKSEN appears at the door. He is poorly but decently dressed, in
            black, with a slightly crumpled white neckcloth; he wears gloves and
            has a felt hat in his hand.)
            
            Aslaksen (bowing). Excuse my taking the liberty, Doctor—
            
            Dr. Stockmann (getting up). Ah, it is you, Aslaksen!
            
            Aslaksen. Yes, Doctor.
            
            Hovstad (standing up). Is it me you want, Aslaksen?
            
            Aslaksen. No; I didn't know I should find you here. No, it was the
            Doctor I—
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I am quite at your service. What is it?
            
            Aslaksen. Is what I heard from Mr. Billing true, sir—that you mean to
            improve our water supply?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, for the Baths.
            
            Aslaksen. Quite so, I understand. Well, I have come to say that I will
            back that up by every means in my power.
            
            Hovstad (to the DOCTOR). You see!
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I shall be very grateful to you, but—
            
            Aslaksen. Because it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at
            your back. We form, as it were, a compact majority in the town—if we
            choose. And it is always a good thing to have the majority with you,
            Doctor.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. That is undeniably true; but I confess I don't see why
            such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case. It seems to
            me that such a plain, straightforward thing—
            
            Aslaksen. Oh, it may be very desirable, all the same. I know our local
            authorities so well; officials are not generally very ready to act on
            proposals that come from other people. That is why I think it would not
            be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration.
            
            Hovstad. That's right.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Demonstration, did you say? What on earth are you going
            to make a demonstration about?
            
            Aslaksen. We shall proceed with the greatest moderation, Doctor.
            Moderation is always my aim; it is the greatest virtue in a citizen—at
            least, I think so.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. It is well known to be a characteristic of yours, Mr.
            Aslaksen.
            
            Aslaksen. Yes, I think I may pride myself on that. And this matter of
            the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen.
            The Baths promise to be a regular gold-mine for the town. We shall all
            make our living out of them, especially those of us who are
            householders. That is why we will back up the project as strongly as
            possible. And as I am at present Chairman of the Householders'
            Association.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes—?
            
            Aslaksen. And, what is more, local secretary of the Temperance
            Society—you know, sir, I suppose, that I am a worker in the temperance
            cause?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Of course, of course.
            
            Aslaksen. Well, you can understand that I come into contact with a
            great many people. And as I have the reputation of a temperate and
            law-abiding citizen—like yourself, Doctor—I have a certain influence
            in the town, a little bit of power, if I may be allowed to say so.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I know that quite well, Mr. Aslaksen.
            
            Aslaksen. So you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot
            some testimonial, if necessary.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. A testimonial?
            
            Aslaksen. Yes, some kind of an address of thanks from the townsmen for
            your share in a matter of such importance to the community. I need
            scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard
            to moderation, so as not to offend the authorities—who, after all,
            have the reins in their hands. If we pay strict attention to that, no
            one can take it amiss, I should think!
            
            Hovstad. Well, and even supposing they didn't like it—
            
            Aslaksen. No, no, no; there must be no discourtesy to the authorities,
            Mr. Hovstad. It is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare
            so closely depends. I have done that in my time, and no good ever comes
            of it. But no one can take exception to a reasonable and frank
            expression of a citizen's views.
            
            Dr. Stockmann (shaking him by the hand). I can't tell you, dear Mr.
            Aslaksen, how extremely pleased I am to find such hearty support among
            my fellow-citizens. I am delighted—delighted! Now, you will take a
            small glass of sherry, eh?
            
            Aslaksen. No, thank you; I never drink alcohol of that kind.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you say to a glass of beer, then?
            
            Aslaksen. Nor that either, thank you, Doctor. I never drink anything as
            early as this. I am going into town now to talk this over with one or
            two householders, and prepare the ground.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. It is tremendously kind of you, Mr. Aslaksen; but I
            really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. It
            seems to me that the thing should go of itself.
            
            Aslaksen. The authorities are somewhat slow to move, Doctor. Far be it
            from me to seem to blame them—
            
            Hovstad. We are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, Aslaksen.
            
            Aslaksen. But not violently, I trust, Mr. Hovstad. Proceed with
            moderation, or you will do nothing with them. You may take my advice; I
            have gathered my experience in the school of life. Well, I must say
            goodbye, Doctor. You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back
            at all events, like a solid wall. You have the compact majority on your
            side Doctor.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I am very much obliged, dear Mr. Aslaksen, (Shakes hands
            with him.) Goodbye, goodbye.
            
            Aslaksen. Are you going my way, towards the printing-office. Mr.
            Hovstad?
            
            Hovstad, I will come later; I have something to settle up first.
            
            Aslaksen. Very well. (Bows and goes out; STOCKMANN follows him into the
            hall.)
            
            Hovstad (as STOCKMANN comes in again). Well, what do you think of that,
            Doctor? Don't you think it is high time we stirred a little life into
            all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Are you referring to Aslaksen?
            
            Hovstad, Yes, I am. He is one of those who are floundering in a
            bog—decent enough fellow though he may be, otherwise. And most of the
            people here are in just the same case—see-sawing and edging first to
            one side and then to the other, so overcome with caution and scruple
            that they never dare to take any decided step.
            
            Dr. Stockmann, Yes, but Aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly
            well-intentioned.
            
            Hovstad. There is one thing I esteem higher than that; and that is for
            a man to be self-reliant and sure of himself.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I think you are perfectly right there.
            
            Hovstad. That is why I want to seize this opportunity, and try if I
            cannot manage to put a little virility into these well-intentioned
            people for once. The idol of Authority must be shattered in this town.
            This gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be
            brought home to the mind of every municipal voter.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Very well; if you are of opinion that it is for the good
            of the community, so be it. But not until I have had a talk with my
            brother.
            
            Hovstad. Anyway, I will get a leading article ready; and if the Mayor
            refuses to take the matter up—
            
            Dr. Stockmann. How can you suppose such a thing possible!
            
            Hovstad. It is conceivable. And in that case—
            
            Dr. Stockmann. In that case I promise you—. Look here, in that case
            you may print my report—every word of it.
            
            Hovstad. May I? Have I your word for it?
            
            Dr. Stockmann (giving him the MS.). Here it is; take it with you. It
            can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back
            later on.
            
            Hovstad. Good, good! That is what I will do. And now goodbye, Doctor.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Goodbye, goodbye. You will see everything will run quite
            smoothly, Mr. Hovstad—quite smoothly.
            
            Hovstad. Hm!—we shall see. (Bows and goes out.)
            
            Dr. Stockmann (opens the dining-room door and looks in). Katherine! Oh,
            you are back, Petra?
            
            Petra (coming in). Yes, I have just come from the school.
            
            Mrs. Stockmann (coming in). Has he not been here yet?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Peter? No, but I have had a long talk with Hovstad. He
            is quite excited about my discovery, I find it has a much wider bearing
            than I at first imagined. And he has put his paper at my disposal if
            necessity should arise.
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Do you think it will?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Not for a moment. But at all events it makes me feel
            proud to know that I have the liberal-minded independent press on my
            side. Yes, and just imagine—I have had a visit from the Chairman of
            the Householders' Association!
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Oh! What did he want?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. To offer me his support too. They will support me in a
            body if it should be necessary. Katherine—do you know what I have got
            behind me?
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Behind you? No, what have you got behind you?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. The compact majority.
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Really? Is that a good thing for you Thomas?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I should think it was a good thing. (Walks up and down
            rubbing his hands.) By Jove, it's a fine thing to feel this bond of
            brotherhood between oneself and one's fellow citizens!
            
            Petra. And to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And for one's own native town into the bargain, my child!
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. That was a ring at the bell.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. It must be he, then. (A knock is heard at the door.)
            Come in!
            
            Peter Stockmann (comes in from the hall). Good morning.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Glad to see you, Peter!
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Good morning, Peter, How are you?
            
            Peter Stockmann. So so, thank you. (To DR. STOCKMANN.) I received from
            you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition
            of the water at the Baths.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes. Have you read it?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Yes, I have,
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And what have you to say to it?
            
            Peter Stockmann (with a sidelong glance). Hm!—
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Come along, Petra. (She and PETRA go into the room on
            the left.)
            
            Peter Stockmann (after a pause). Was it necessary to make all these
            investigations behind my back?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, because until I was absolutely certain about it—
            
            Peter Stockmann. Then you mean that you are absolutely certain now?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Surely you are convinced of that.
            
            Peter Stockmann. Is it your intention to bring this document before the
            Baths Committee as a sort of official communication?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Certainly. Something must be done in the matter—and
            that quickly.
            
            Peter Stockmann. As usual, you employ violent expressions in your
            report. You say, amongst other things, that what we offer visitors in
            our Baths is a permanent supply of poison.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Well, can you describe it any other way, Peter? Just
            think—water that is poisonous, whether you drink it or bathe in it!
            And this we offer to the poor sick folk who come to us trustfully and
            pay us at an exorbitant rate to be made well again!
            
            Peter Stockmann. And your reasoning leads you to this conclusion, that
            we must build a sewer to draw off the alleged impurities from Molledal
            and must relay the water conduits.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes. Do you see any other way out of it? I don't.
            
            Peter Stockmann. I made a pretext this morning to go and see the town
            engineer, and, as if only half seriously, broached the subject of these
            proposals as a thing we might perhaps have to take under consideration
            some time later on.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Some time later on!
            
            Peter Stockmann. He smiled at what he considered to be my extravagance,
            naturally. Have you taken the trouble to consider what your proposed
            alterations would cost? According to the information I obtained, the
            expenses would probably mount up to fifteen or twenty thousand pounds.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Would it cost so much?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Yes; and the worst part of it would be that the work
            would take at least two years.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Two years? Two whole years?
            
            Peter Stockmann. At least. And what are we to do with the Baths in the
            meantime? Close them? Indeed we should be obliged to. And do you
            suppose anyone would come near the place after it had got out that the
            water was dangerous?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes but, Peter, that is what it is.
            
            Peter Stockmann. And all this at this juncture—just as the Baths are
            beginning to be known. There are other towns in the neighbourhood with
            qualifications to attract visitors for bathing purposes. Don't you
            suppose they would immediately strain every nerve to divert the entire
            stream of strangers to themselves? Unquestionably they would; and then
            where should we be? We should probably have to abandon the whole thing,
            which has cost us so much money-and then you would have ruined your
            native town.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I—should have ruined—!
            
            Peter Stockmann. It is simply and solely through the Baths that the
            town has before it any future worth mentioning. You know that just as
            well as I.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. But what do you think ought to be done, then?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Your report has not convinced me that the condition of
            the water at the Baths is as bad as you represent it to be.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I tell you it is even worse!—or at all events it will
            be in summer, when the warm weather comes.
            
            Peter Stockmann. As I said, I believe you exaggerate the matter
            considerably. A capable physician ought to know what measures to
            take—he ought to be capable of preventing injurious influences or of
            remedying them if they become obviously persistent.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Well? What more?
            
            Peter Stockmann. The water supply for the Baths is now an established
            fact, and in consequence must be treated as such. But probably the
            Committee, at its discretion, will not be disinclined to consider the
            question of how far it might be possible to introduce certain
            improvements consistently with a reasonable expenditure.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And do you suppose that I will have anything to do with
            such a piece of trickery as that?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Trickery!!
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it would be a trick—a fraud, a lie, a downright
            crime towards the public, towards the whole community!
            
            Peter Stockmann. I have not, as I remarked before, been able to
            convince myself that there is actually any imminent danger.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. You have! It is impossible that you should not be
            convinced. I know I have represented the facts absolutely truthfully
            and fairly. And you know it very well, Peter, only you won't
            acknowledge it. It was owing to your action that both the Baths and the
            water conduits were built where they are; and that is what you won't
            acknowledge—that damnable blunder of yours. Pooh!—do you suppose I
            don't see through you?
            
            Peter Stockmann. And even if that were true? If I perhaps guard my
            reputation somewhat anxiously, it is in the interests of the town.
            Without moral authority I am powerless to direct public affairs as
            seems, to my judgment, to be best for the common good. And on that
            account—and for various other reasons too—it appears to me to be a
            matter of importance that your report should not be delivered to the
            Committee. In the interests of the public, you must withhold it. Then,
            later on, I will raise the question and we will do our best, privately;
            but nothing of this unfortunate affair not a single word of it—must
            come to the ears of the public.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I am afraid you will not be able to prevent that now, my
            dear Peter.
            
            Peter Stockmann. It must and shall be prevented.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. It is no use, I tell you. There are too many people that
            know about it.
            
            Peter Stockmann. That know about it? Who? Surely you don't mean those
            fellows on the "People's Messenger"?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, they know. The liberal-minded independent press is
            going to see that you do your duty.
            
            Peter Stockmann (after a short pause). You are an extraordinarily
            independent man, Thomas. Have you given no thought to the consequences
            this may have for yourself?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Consequences?—for me?
            
            Peter Stockmann. For you and yours, yes.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce do you mean?
            
            Peter Stockmann. I believe I have always behaved in a brotherly way to
            you—haven't I always been ready to oblige or to help you?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, you have, and I am grateful to you for it.
            
            Peter Stockmann. There is no need. Indeed, to some extent I was forced
            to do so—for my own sake. I always hoped that, if I helped to improve
            your financial position, I should be able to keep some check on you.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. What! Then it was only for your own sake—!
            
            Peter Stockmann. Up to a certain point, yes. It is painful for a man in
            an official position to have his nearest relative compromising himself
            time after time.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And do you consider that I do that?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Yes, unfortunately, you do, without even being aware
            of it. You have a restless, pugnacious, rebellious disposition. And
            then there is that disastrous propensity of yours to want to write
            about every sort of possible and impossible thing. The moment an idea
            comes into your head, you must needs go and write a newspaper article
            or a whole pamphlet about it.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Well, but is it not the duty of a citizen to let the
            public share in any new ideas he may have?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Oh, the public doesn't require any new ideas. The
            public is best served by the good, old established ideas it already has.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And that is your honest opinion?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Yes, and for once I must talk frankly to you. Hitherto
            I have tried to avoid doing so, because I know how irritable you are;
            but now I must tell you the truth, Thomas. You have no conception what
            an amount of harm you do yourself by your impetuosity. You complain of
            the authorities, you even complain of the government—you are always
            pulling them to pieces; you insist that you have been neglected and
            persecuted. But what else can such a cantankerous man as you expect?
            
            Dr. Stockmann. What next! Cantankerous, am I?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Yes, Thomas, you are an extremely cantankerous man to
            work with—I know that to my cost. You disregard everything that you
            ought to have consideration for. You seem completely to forget that it
            is me you have to thank for your appointment here as medical officer to
            the Baths.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I was entitled to it as a matter of course!—I and
            nobody else! I was the first person to see that the town could be made
            into a flourishing watering-place, and I was the only one who saw it at
            that time. I had to fight single-handed in support of the idea for many
            years; and I wrote and wrote—
            
            Peter Stockmann. Undoubtedly. But things were not ripe for the scheme
            then—though, of course, you could not judge of that in your
            out-of-the-way corner up north. But as soon as the opportune moment
            came I—and the others—took the matter into our hands.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and made this mess of all my beautiful plan. It is
            pretty obvious now what clever fellows you were!
            
            Peter Stockmann. To my mind the whole thing only seems to mean that you
            are seeking another outlet for your combativeness. You want to pick a
            quarrel with your superiors—an old habit of yours. You cannot put up
            with any authority over you. You look askance at anyone who occupies a
            superior official position; you regard him as a personal enemy, and
            then any stick is good enough to beat him with. But now I have called
            your attention to the fact that the town's interests are at stake—and,
            incidentally, my own too. And therefore, I must tell you, Thomas, that
            you will find me inexorable with regard to what I am about to require
            you to do.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And what is that?
            
            Peter Stockmann. As you have been so indiscreet as to speak of this
            delicate matter to outsiders, despite the fact that you ought to have
            treated it as entirely official and confidential, it is obviously
            impossible to hush it up now. All sorts of rumours will get about
            directly, and everybody who has a grudge against us will take care to
            embellish these rumours. So it will be necessary for you to refute them
            publicly.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I! How? I don't understand.
            
            Peter Stockmann. What we shall expect is that, after making further
            investigations, you will come to the conclusion that the matter is not
            by any means as dangerous or as critical as you imagined in the first
            instance.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Oho!—so that is what you expect!
            
            Peter Stockmann. And, what is more, we shall expect you to make public
            profession of your confidence in the Committee and in their readiness
            to consider fully and conscientiously what steps may be necessary to
            remedy any possible defects.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. But you will never be able to do that by patching and
            tinkering at it—never! Take my word for it, Peter; I mean what I say,
            as deliberately and emphatically as possible.
            
            Peter Stockmann. As an officer under the Committee, you have no right
            to any individual opinion.
            
            Dr. Stockmann (amazed). No right?
            
            Peter Stockmann. In your official capacity, no. As a private person, it
            is quite another matter. But as a subordinate member of the staff of
            the Baths, you have no right to express any opinion which runs contrary
            to that of your superiors.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. This is too much! I, a doctor, a man of science, have no
            right to—!
            
            Peter Stockmann. The matter in hand is not simply a scientific one. It
            is a complicated matter, and has its economic as well as its technical
            side.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. I don't care what it is! I intend to be free to express
            my opinion on any subject under the sun.
            
            Peter Stockmann. As you please—but not on any subject concerning the
            Baths. That we forbid.
            
            Dr. Stockmann (shouting). You forbid—! You! A pack of—
            
            Peter Stockmann.  I forbid it—I, your chief; and if I forbid it, you
            have to obey.
            
            Dr. Stockmann (controlling himself). Peter—if you were not my brother—
            
            Petra (throwing open the door). Father, you shan't stand this!
            
            Mrs. Stockmann (coming in after her). Petra, Petra!
            
            Peter Stockmann. Oh, so you have been eavesdropping.
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. You were talking so loud, we couldn't help it!
            
            Petra. Yes, I was listening.
            
            Peter Stockmann. Well, after all, I am very glad—
            
            Dr. Stockmann (going up to him). You were saying something about
            forbidding and obeying?
            
            Peter Stockmann. You obliged me to take that tone with you.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And so I am to give myself the lie, publicly?
            
            Peter Stockmann. We consider it absolutely necessary that you should
            make some such public statement as I have asked for.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. And if I do not—obey?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Then we shall publish a statement ourselves to
            reassure the public.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Very well; but in that case I shall use my pen against
            you. I stick to what I have said; I will show that I am right and that
            you are wrong. And what will you do then?
            
            Peter Stockmann. Then I shall not be able to prevent your being
            dismissed.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. What—?
            
            Petra. Father—dismissed!
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Dismissed!
            
            Peter Stockmann. Dismissed from the staff of the Baths. I shall be
            obliged to propose that you shall immediately be given notice, and
            shall not be allowed any further participation in the Baths' affairs.
            
            Dr. Stockmann. You would dare to do that!
            
            Peter Stockmann. It is you that are playing the daring game.
            
            Petra. Uncle, that is a shameful way to treat a man like father!
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Do hold your tongue, Petra!
            
            Peter Stockmann (looking at PETRA). Oh, so we volunteer our opinions
            already, do we? Of course. (To MRS. STOCKMANN.) Katherine, I imagine
            you are the most sensible person in this house. Use any influence you
            may have over your husband, and make him see what this will entail for
            his family.
